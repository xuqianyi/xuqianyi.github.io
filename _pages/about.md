<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

 I am a Ph.D. student at [Mornin's Lab](https://www.mornin-feng.com/), [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg/), supervised by Prof. [Feng Mengling](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=F2ET1WsAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). My research focuses on applying machine learning, especially reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize decision-making process with wide applications in healthcare. My current research interests include multi-agent RL, hierarchical RL and model-based RL. Previously, I have also worked on continual learning and generative models with applications in image segmentation and time-series data.
 
 I graduated from [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/) with a bachelor's degree from [Electrical and Electronic Engineering](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/eee). I was awarded with NTU Science and Engineering Undergraduate Scholarship in 2019. 

<!-- My research interest includes neural machine translation and computer vision. I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>). -->
